## Heroku Link
Check out our app on Heroku! http://colorcoder.herokuapp.com/

## List of Features
This app allows visitors to the site to see and search all the colors and reviews stored in our database, as entered by themselves or other users. Visitors can sign up for an account which will allow them to post and edit colors, and post and edit and reviews of their own. Users designated as "Admins" have the added ability to delete colors, reviews, and users.

For a more complete list of features, see "User Stories & Acceptance Criteria" below.

## Technologies in this Project
This project is built using **Ruby on Rails** and incorporates **React.js** components. It uses **Devise** for user authentication, **RSpec** and **Capybara** for testing, **Sass** for styling, and **PostgreSQL** for database management.

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
This section outlines some of user stories and acceptance criteria used to drive our development. For the purposes of these user stories, a **visitor** is an unauthenticated user (that is, a user who has not signed in); a **user** is an authenticated user (that is, a user who has signed up and signed in); and an **admin** is an authenticated user with admin privileges (that is, a user who has signed up, signed in, and been designated as an "admin").
